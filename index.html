                    <h3>Investment Approvals Application</h3>
                    <p class="normal">Innovation Lead – RSK Group Ltd</p>
                    <p>In collaboration with digital solutions colleagues, Group IT, and Finance, I spearheaded the
                        design, development, testing,
                        and implementation of a comprehensive group-wide approval process using Power Platform,
                        SharePoint, and O365. This initiative
                        replaced a manual system, introducing a bespoke automated solution that supported operational
                        efficiency
                        and transparency while concurrently reducing administration costs and errors.
                        <br></br>
                        The system architecture employed a multi-page PowerApps Canvas App integrated with related
                        SharePoint Lists for streamlined data
                        storage and look-ups. The approval pathway was dynamically configured, responding to a range of
                        inputs, and executed seamlessly through
                        PowerAutomate. To ensure user-friendly interactions, a guided form was hosted in both SharePoint
                        and Teams, and accessible through embedded
                        email responses. Users navigated the system with ease, guided by concise prompts and reminders
                        tailored to the specific context of their interactions.
                        <br></br>
                        This project exemplifies my commitment to leveraging digital tools to create tailored solutions
                        that not only meet organizational needs
                        but also enhance user experience and operational effectiveness.

                    <h3>Award-Winning Tracking and Support Hub <span class="trophy-icon"> </span></h3>
                    <p class="normal">Innovation Lead – RSK Group Ltd</p>
                    <p>In response to identifying substantial lost effort and sales within our major bids’ functions, I
                        collaborated with colleagues to
                        develop a comprehensive tracking and support hub. This innovative solution, seamlessly
                        integrated with group ERP systems, delivered
                        timely and relevant information to key stakeholders, resulting in a notable increase in the
                        success rate of major bids.
                        <br></br>
                        The core of the system was a dynamic PowerApps Canvas App intricately linked with related
                        SharePoint Lists. To achieve integration
                        with the existing ERP system, a combination of PowerShell, Excel (utilising ODBC), and
                        PowerAutomate was employed. This integration
                        facilitated the flow of data, ensuring that stakeholders had access to the most up-to-date
                        information.
                        <br></br>
                        The reporting functionality was robustly enabled through a PowerBI Dashboard, empowering leaders
                        to dynamically interrogate data and
                        derive valuable insights. This project exemplifies my ability to identify operational
                        inefficiencies, collaborate on innovative solutions,
                        and implement systems that drive tangible improvements in key performance metrics.

                    <h3>Digital Environmental Impact Assessment</h3>
                    <p class="normal">Environmental Planner & Innovation Lead – RSK Group Ltd</p>
                    <p>I worked on a concept for Digital Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) over a period of
                        approximately 4 years.
                        This initially entailed talking to clients and colleagues about the purpose, value and audience
                        for
                        EIA and the conceptual
                        benefits and viability of digitisation.
                        <br></br>
                        Presenting to a major strategic land client I was met with the response "the only people who
                        read an
                        EIA are you and the lawyers,
                        Mark". Whilst a slightly glib remark it reinforced the complex nature of this service and the
                        need
                        to be clear about the value
                        you endeavour to generate. In response I conducted a review of case law summarising key
                        judgements
                        and their influence on practice.
                        <br></br>
                        Later I convened a design thinking session, bringing together subject matter experts from across
                        the
                        group for a day long session.
                        We identified and idealised customers, generated value propositions, brainstormed solutions,
                        appraised viability and identified
                        preferred options to progress. The ability to distill clear direction in complexity and bring
                        people
                        with you was key to this
                        project.

                    <h3>Multivariant Analysis & Research</h3>
                    <p class="normal">Sustainability Advisor – Matilda’s Planet</p>
                    <p>In the capacity of advising investors on renewable technologies, I undertook a comprehensive
                        research initiative involving both
                        primary and secondary research methods. Focusing on solar thermal technologies, I took a unique
                        approach by reverse-engineering
                        the SAP calculator and conducting a multivariant analysis to discern the key drivers of returns
                        under the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI).
                        <br></br>
                        This meticulous analysis was instrumental in presenting a nuanced understanding to the board. By
                        adopting my recommendations, the board
                        demonstrated a strategic alignment with the identified key drivers, ultimately enhancing the
                        effectiveness of their commercial evaluation process.
                        <br></br>
                        The project's significance lay in the recognition that, at the time, effective commercial
                        evaluation of solar thermal technology necessitated
                        a nuanced appreciation of the distinction between a technologically sound solution and one
                        poised to yield returns under the RHI. This project
                        showcases my ability to apply both technical and strategic insights to provide actionable
                        recommendations in complex decision-making scenarios.

                    <h3>Data and Process Mapping</h3>
                    <p class="normal">Innovation Lead – RSK Group Ltd</p>
                    <p>Collaborating closely with key stakeholders, including the Group Sustainability Lead, Reporting
                        Lead, Facilities Management, Finance, and IT,
                        I spearheaded the creation of a comprehensive data and process map for carbon emissions
                        calculations. This initiative covered a thorough examination
                        of data sources, processes, and calculations specifically focused on Scope 1 & 2 emissions.
                        <br></br>
                        The project aimed to enhance transparency and efficiency in carbon emissions reporting. Through
                        meticulous mapping, we streamlined the data flow and
                        calculation processes, ensuring accuracy and consistency in reporting. Notably, I worked closely
                        with the team to create a robust framework that aligned
                        with industry standards and organizational goals.
                        <br></br>
                        While Scope 3 emissions were initially out of scope for mapping, I took the initiative to
                        evaluate various technologies for data gathering, especially
                        from sources such as PDFs. This proactive approach demonstrated my commitment to continuous
                        improvement and staying abreast of emerging technologies
                        to enhance the comprehensiveness of our emissions data.
                        <br></br>
                        This project showcases my ability to collaborate across diverse functional areas, aligning
                        technical processes with sustainability goals, and
                        proactively exploring opportunities for process optimization and technological advancements.

                    <h3>Business case development and advocacy</h3>
                    <p class="normal">Innovation Lead – RSK Group Ltd</p>
                    <p>As a founding member of the Digital Solutions team at RSK, I leveraged my advocacy and business
                        case development skills to propel the team
                        and individual projects forward. A key component of this effort was the creation of simple yet
                        impactful business canvases, strategically
                        designed to maintain focus on the value proposition and revenue streams within a business
                        centered on the expertise of its professionals.
                        <br></br>
                        One notable achievement involved the introduction of a Digital EIA (Environmental Impact
                        Assessment) product. To align the development with
                        the needs of our diverse client base, I organized and facilitated a workshop day. Attended by
                        experts from across the group, the workshop
                        delved into an appreciation of our customers, the value we provided them, and how innovative
                        products could elevate our proposition.
                        <br></br>
                        The outcomes of this collaborative session served as a guide for development goals, ultimately
                        securing divisional funding. This project
                        exemplifies my ability to not only advocate for digital solutions but to strategically align
                        them with market needs, ensuring sustained
                        growth and success.

                    <h3>Data Analytics and Visualisation</h3>
                    <p class="normal">Open Data Institute</p>
                    <p>As part of my strategic data course, I conducted an in-depth appraisal of publicly available data
                        from the London Fire Brigade. This comprehensive
                        project encompassed every facet of the data lifecycle, from meticulous data sourcing, cleaning,
                        and structuring to rigorous evaluation, statistical
                        analysis, and visual representation.
                        <br></br>
                        Leveraging PowerBI, I created a compelling visualization that went beyond traditional reporting.
                        The visualisation not only presented statistical
                        insights but also effectively challenged the life-saving credentials of automated fire alarms.
                        By articulating the data's narrative, I underscored
                        the importance of continued efforts in this critical area.
                        <br></br>
                        This project showcased my proficiency in the end-to-end data analysis process, from raw data
                        handling to the creation of impactful visualisations,
                        all while maintaining a keen awareness of ethical considerations.
